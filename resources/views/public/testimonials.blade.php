“We have traveled overseas with other tour companies but after our experience in London we will never again travel with anyone else. The trip was informative and designed specifically for us and we were allowed to explore and enjoy this beautiful city instead of being rushed from one landmark to the next. We had the best time…and the food: THE FOOD! Thanks, Michael, for a trip our kids will never forget.”</div>

<div class="quotebox">“Our New York tour this year was absolutely fabulous. I've traveled to NYC and London over a dozen times in the last 20 years with a couple other companies. This was BY FAR the most personalized tour we've gotten mostly due to the attention of office manager Diana Strom and our incredible tour guide, Bruce Roberts. Being a theatre class, we were given some incredible opportunities for backstage tours and getting a wonderful &quot;history of Broadway&quot; tour from Bruce. Thanks so much for the wonderful memories!”</div>

“We loved traveling with Dragaud Sojourns. The itinerary was exciting, lodging spectacular, and the restaurant choices wonderful! The attention to detail made our trip to London a memory of a lifetime not only for our students but for the teachers as well. We can’t wait to do it again.”</div><div class="author">

<div class="quotebox">“Before traveling with Michael we had tried several different tour companies but we will NEVER<br />
    again travel with any company other than Dragaud Sojourns. The food is better, the hotels are better, and the service is in a completely different league. There’s no comparison. Dragaud Sojourns is the only way to go.”</div><div class="author">
