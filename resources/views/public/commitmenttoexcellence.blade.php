     <p> Dragaud Custom Sojourns is dedicated to creating extraordinary educational experiences for you and your students.  I strive to offer you a unique opportunity to embrace the true culture of a city or region, to immerse yourself in all its quirks and charms, to consider a different way of traveling. </p>
     <p> Since 1995 I have worked with middle schools, high schools, and universities to share my passion for travel.  My goal, as always, is to offer you the best possible value for money but, in the end, it’s not why we travel or even where we travel that distinguishes a truly unforgettable journey from a merely good one.  It’s how we travel, and at Dragaud Custom Sojourns, that is everything.</p>
